## The  Laboratory  for  Visual,  Embodied  and  Immersive  Data  Analysis  (VEIDA)

The  Laboratory  for  Visual,  Embodied  and  Immersive  Data  Analysis  (VEIDA),  is  a  state-of-the-art research facility that supports the development of interactive and immersive frameworks for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Frameworks that attempt to deal with traditional barriers to comprehension by investigating novel tools and strategies that leverage human visual reasoning together with tactile and motor perception, to promote enhanced cognition, comprehension, and knowledge discovery.

Unique  within  Canada,  VEIDA  is  a  highly  reconfigurable  lab  that will  enable  the  rapid development  of  innovative  visuo-tangible  frameworks  for  EDA,  utilized  in  applications  deployed  across a range sectors from cultural heritage, to 3D multimedia, manufacturing, biology, health and medicine. With data  and  analytics  projected  to  be  a  major  driver  of  revenue  growth  in the coming  years,  and  the  massive growth in immersive technologies. VEIDA will strengthen Canada's leadership in existing and emerging digital economies.
